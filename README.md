## Your First Angular 4 Web Application
In this chapter weâ€™re going to build an application that allows the user  generate a quiz from a json file
### Getting started
### Angular-cli
[Angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli#usage) is a command line tool for creating Angular applicaions ,generate components, routes, services and pipes 
#### Prerequisites
- Make Sure that you have  Node 6.9.0 or higher,  with NPM 3 or higher installed
```bash
node --version
```
#### Installation
**BEFORE YOU INSTALL:** please read the [prerequisites](#prerequisites)
```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```
#### Usage

```bash
ng new
```
this command creates a new angular application ,it takes one parameter [name] , it will be created in the current location in [name] directory , 
you can also pass other [parameters](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/wiki/new) such as  -dir  , --style 

```bash
ng generate
```
it takes the blueprint as parameter (class , component , directive ....) , you can check the list of all available blueprints 
[here](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/wiki/generate#available-blueprints)

```bash
ng serve
```
Builds the application and starts a web server ,buy default it uses the port 4000,  you can change it by adding this paramater --port (aliases: -p) ,

- **NOTE**  When running ng serve, the compiled output is served from memory, not from disk. This means that the application being served is not located on disk in the dist folder.
